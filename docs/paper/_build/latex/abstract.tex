Different manoeuvring performance models have been investigated with their parameters identified by the proposed PIT method. In this paper, the robust VMM with proper parameters (hydrodynamic derivatives) is first chosen to describe a shipâ€™s manoeuvring. To estimate the coefficients, this method can solve the data noise from model tests or full-scale measurements by combing the inverse dynamics regression and Extended Kalman Filter with a RTS smoother. The multicollinearity problems in the VMMs are addressed by introducing the thrust force models for different ship types. Two case study vessels with very different manoeuverability characteristics are used to demonstrate and validate the proposed method to build a VMM for their manoeuver.

	abstract = {Partial least squares (PLS) regression is used for identifying the hydrodynamic derivatives in the Abkowitz model for ship maneuvering motion. To identify the dynamic characteristics in ship maneuvering motion, the derivatives of hydrodynamic model's outputs are set as the target output of the PLS identification model. To verify the effectiveness of PLS parametric identification method in processing data with high dimensionality and heavy multicollinearity, the identified results of the hydrodynamic derivatives from the simulated 20 deg/20 deg zigzag test are compared with the planar motion mechanism (PMM) test results. The performance of PLS regression is also compared with that of the conventional least squares (LS) regression using the same dataset. Simulation results show the satisfactory identification and generalization performances of PLS regression and its superiority in comparison with the LS method, which demonstrates its capability in processing measurement data with high dimensionality and heavy multicollinearity, especially in processing data with small sample size.},

The techniques used include output error, maximum likelihood and more general prediction error methods. Different model structures have been investigated ranging from input-output models in difference equa.tion form to the equations of motion in their natural form. Effects of disturbances, errors and dynamics in sensors and actuators have been considered. Programs for interactive system identification have been used extensively. The experiments have been performed both under open loop and closed loop conditions. Both linear and nonlinear models have been considered. The paper summarizes the experiences obtained from applying system identification methods to many different ships. The results have been applied both to investigate steering properties and to design autopilots for ship steering. Insight into ship steering dynamics and identification methodology has been obtained.},

	abstract = {We present a modular mathematical model and a reference technique for the rapid estimation of maneuvering trajectories and motion time histories of single- and twin-screw propulsion ships. Heave, roll and pitch radiation damping are estimated from a non-linear unified seakeeping/maneuvering time-domain tool using numerical decay tests and then implemented to a 6–DoF model in the form of critical damping and natural period. Short waves are idealised by numerical integration along the vessel’s waterline profile and associated hydrodynamic actions are implemented in a response curve format. For the rapid assessment of hull in-plane hydrodynamic forces, derivatives are implemented via semi-empirical methods, CFD or model test data. Results are validated against experiments available for zig-zag and turning cycle trajectories of vessels with different hull forms and propulsion configurations. It is concluded that the approach presented is feasible for the prediction of maneu­ vering trajectories of existing or new-build vessels and for estimating the evasive velocity in way of contact before grounding.},

The sailing hybrid ship will operate with leeway (drift) angles to produce a lateral force known as sideforce, for steady operation under sail. In this paper, experimental results for the sailing performance of ships fitted with bilge keel appendages are presented. Systematic variations in appendage height, length, and position were tested, including several special cases (multiple bilge keels). The appendage typology is shown to mitigate the strong ‘destabilizing’ yaw moment that is characteristic of wind-assisted commercial vessels and to promote the non-linear sideforce component. The working principal for bilge keels—promotion of flow separation—can be employed to specify the separation location for components of the vessel vortex wake to improve the sailing performance of the ship.},

A Mariner Class vessel is taken as the study object. The time series used in training and testing the network is the simulated data of a series of maneuvers, which is obtained by numerically solving the Abkowitz model using fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. A three-layer neural network is built to solve this multivariable regression fitting problem, and only one network model is trained to predict various ship maneuvers. Taking the mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function, the network’s weights are optimized by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm effectively. The trained network is evaluated by several simulation tests, and it is shown that the network achieves good prediction ability and can predict the maneuvering motion as long as the control inputs and initial states of the ship motion are known.},

Forecasts of the vessels’ trajectories and motions are fundamentally based on the mathematical manoeuvring model, which is an essential component of their hydrodynamic digital twin nowadays. Using the benchmark container ship KCS as an object of study, this paper adopts a 4-DOF modular-type manoeuvring (MMG) model to predict the vessel trajectories in calm water and under the presence of steady current and regular waves. The current effects are treated as additional ship over water speed, while the wave effects are considered by superimposing the second-order mean wave drift loads to the calm water hull hydrodynamics. The wave drift loads are solved using the potential ﬂow solver WASIM, which is based on Rankine panel method. The computed vessel trajectories and motions are compared with available literature results and show good correlation.},

The experimental data as well should be set-up in an input file. The benchmark automatically creates input files for the chosen manoeuvring software, runs the software and manages the output files. It reads from these outputs, collects the model test measurements and plots the results. Some test-cases are presented in the paper, showing the potentialities and flexibility of the benchmark.

	abstract = {In many situations the manoeuvering performance of ships is largely effected by the non-linear contributions of the hydrodynamic reaction forces on the hull. The origin of these non-linear components can be ascertained from experiments with segmented models. In this paper a review is given of the analysis of the segmented model tests which have been reported in literature so far. From the results derived from this analysis it will be shown that the non-linear hull force and moment components can be described in a robust manner by means of a longitudinal distribution of the so-called cross-flow drag coefficient. Thus, a good description of the ship's manoeuvrability is acquired for the entire speed range of a vessel, including the transition from the manoeuvres at service speed with relatively small drift angles to the manoeuvres at reduced speed (harbour manoeuvering) with large drift angles.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this study is to investigate the turning and zig-zag maneuvering performance of the well-known naval surface combatant DTMB (David Taylor Model Basin) 5415 hull with URANS (Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) method. Numerical simulations of static drift tests have been performed by a commercial RANS solver based on a finite volume method (FVM) in an unsteady manner. The fluid flow is considered as 3-D, incompressible and fully turbulent. Hydrodynamic analyses have been carried out for a fixed Froude number 0.28. During the analyses, the free surface effects have been taken into account using VOF (Volume of Fluid) method and the hull is considered as fixed. First, the code has been validated with the available experimental data in literature. After validation, static drift, static rudder and drift and rudder tests have been simulated. The forces and moments acting on the hull have been computed with URANS approach. Numerical results have been applied to determine the hydrodynamic maneuvering coefficients, such as, velocity terms and rudder terms. The acceleration, angular velocity and cross-coupled terms have been taken from the available experimental data. A computer program has been developed to apply a fast maneuvering simulation technique. Abkowitz’s non-linear mathematical model has been used to calculate the forces and moment acting on the hull during the maneuvering motion. Euler method on the other hand has been applied to solve the simultaneous differential equations. Turning and zig-zag maneuvering simulations have been carried out and the maneuvering characteristics have been determined and the numerical simulation results have been compared with the available data in literature. In addition, viscous effects have been investigated using Eulerian approach for several static drift cases.},

This setup gave possibility to measure the most important forces and still having a realistic displacement, or wetted surface, for the ship model.

permits predicting ship motions and therefore advancing control safety and maneuverability for the offshore ship

hydrodynamic coefficients to establish highly accurate mathematical models. In this paper, a support vector machine
method is proposed for the hydrodynamic parameter identification of a nonlinear maneuvering model for a surface

maneuvering datasets are included as training data. The 3-DOF hydrodynamic derivatives are identified and
validated by the multiple support vector regression model. The generalization performance of the obtained nonlinear
model is explored by comparing the outputs of the identified model with the original maneuvering data on the
evaluation dataset, a dataset that contains separate variable zigzag and turning circle maneuvers tests. The
satisfactory agreements between predicted motions and original motions demonstrate the validity and generalization

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the fundamental properties associated with the Nomoto models. Specifically, the state space model associated with the first order Nomoto model is both observable and controllable. The state space model associated with the second order Nomoto model is also observable; however, it is controllable only if the effective sway time constant is different from the effective yaw time constant. The zero appearing in the transfer function model is found responsible for the overshoot behaviors, which are typical in the yaw rate for large rudder angle steering. This suggests that a second order Nomoto model is more appropriate if the overshoot feature is to be properly modeled. Both the first and second order Nomoto transfer function models are identifiable, with an ill-conditioning problem associated the latter. This makes the first order Nomoto model very popular in the adaptive autopilot applications. Model reduction for a fourth order transfer function ship model describing the sway-yaw-roll dynamics is conducted to reach the second order Nomoto model describing the sway-yaw dynamics and the first order Nomoto model describing the yaw dynamics itself, and the Bode plots for these models are given to show the changes in system frequency response caused by model simplification. Thus, appropriate model structures can be selected according to the intended frequency range of application to meet the modeling accuracy requirements.},

	abstract = {Determination of ship maneuvering models is a tough task of ship maneuverability prediction. Among several prime approaches of estimating ship maneuvering models, system identification combined with the full‐scale or free‐ running model test is preferred. In this contribution, real‐time system identification programs using recursive identification method, such as the recursive least square method (RLS), are exerted for on‐line identification of ship maneuvering models. However, this method seriously depends on the objects of study and initial values of identified parameters. To overcome this, an intelligent technology, i.e., support vector machines (SVM), is firstly used to estimate initial values of the identified parameters with finite samples. As real measured motion data of the Mariner class ship always involve noise from sensors and external disturbances, the zigzag simulation test data include a substantial quantity of Gaussian white noise. Wavelet method and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) are used to filter the data corrupted by noise, respectively. The choice of the sample number for SVM to decide initial values of identified parameters is extensively discussed and analyzed. With de‐noised motion data as input‐output training samples, parameters of ship maneuvering models are estimated using RLS and SVM‐RLS, respectively. The comparison between identification results and true values of parameters demonstrates that both the identified ship maneuvering models from RLS and SVM‐RLS have reasonable agreements with simulated motions of the ship, and the increment of the sample for SVM positively affects the identification results. Furthermore, SVM‐RLS using data de‐noised by EMD shows the highest accuracy and best convergence.},

	abstract = {Ship manoeuvrability has been generally predicted based on 3-DOF mathematical model. However, medium-high speed ships such as containerships and passenger ferries make sometimes a large roll motion by the steering, which more or less affects on the ship manoeuvrability. Although a lot of researches have been done about the effect of roll motion, the mathematical models of hydrodynamic forces have been proposed individually putting the additional terms of roll angle into the conventional 3-DOF mathematical model. This makes the difficulty in the prediction of manoeuvrability.
In this paper, the captive model tests have been performed with a container ship and a passenger ferry. In order to grasp the characteristics of the effect of roll angle on the conventional 3-DOF mathematical model, CMT(Circular Motion Test) have been carried out with setting a constant roll angles. And then, the effects of roll angle on the hydrodynamic derivatives have been extracted. From this analysis, the suitable 4-DOF mathematical model has been introduced by means of eliminating the less contributing terms of the roll effect. For the validation of the proposed mathematical model, free running model tests were carried out with several GM and ship’s speed since the roll angle during a manoeuvring is affected by them. After comparing simulated results by the proposed 4-DOF mathematical model and the results of free running model test, it is found that the effect of GM and ship’s speed on turning trajectories or the overshoot of Z-test can be well predicted by the proposed 4-DOF mathematical model.},

Motion dynamics of a ship regarded as a rigid body in a general motion with six-degree-of-freedom is considered. The relation of non-linearities of the applied sub-models to the physical phenomena associated with the ship behavior is discussed. Surface wave theory is presented. Non-linearities associated with surface waves are discussed. Realization of the unified mathematical model in a form of simulation tool, called LaiDyn, is discussed and examples of its applications are shown. Mathematical model for assessing internal hull girder loads is presented briefly. An un-symmetry of internal loads, visible as different maximum values of sagging and hogging, is presented and the origins of it are discussed.},

A highly accurate dynamic ship model promotes predicting ship motions and advancing control safety for the offshore ship systems. It is crucial to identify the uncertain hydrodynamic coefficients under environmental disturbance to establish accurate mathematical models. In this paper, the identification procedure for a 3 degree of freedom hydrodynamic model under disturbance is completed based on the support vector machine method with multiple maneuvers datasets. The algorithm is validated on the clean ship model and the results present good fitness with the reference. Experiments in different sea states are designed and conducted to investigate the effects of the turbulence on the identified model fidelity. Generalization results show that the models identified in the gentle and moderate environments have less than 10\% deviations and are considered allowable. The higher perturbations, the lower fidelity of the identified model. Models identified under disturbance could provide different levels of reliable support for the operation decision system.},

However, creating an advanced model that comprehensively represents the system and its interaction with dynamic environments has always been challenging. Many models provide partial knowledge about a system. To handle the deﬁciency and improve model ﬁdelity, we propose a hybrid modeling methodology, in which prior knowledge describing the ship dynamic effects is incorporated into a data-driven calibrator, yielding a representative model with high predictive capability. Enabled by the integration of model estimated ship states into the calibrator, the informative information could be interpreted and carried forward. Simulation and full-scale experiments are conducted on the research vessel Gunnerus to exemplify the concept. A best available numerical model and a neural network are prepared to be the foundation and calibrator, respectively. Experiment results show that the cooperative model greatly improves the predictive capability of the research vessel. From the ship modeling perspective, this study provides new insights by bridging the gap between two separate domains: model-based and data-driven.},

The basis for the control system is a nonlinear maneuvering model that describes the coupled motions in surge, sway and yaw. In order to follow a predefined path, the ship must be equipped with minimum two actuators that produce a surge force and a yaw moment. Moreover, only two controls are needed to control an under actuated ship in three Degrees Of Freedom (DOF). Path following is achieved by a geometric assignment based on a LOS projection algorithm for minimization of the cross-track error to the path. The LOS algorithm computes heading angle commands to the autopilot system.The desired speed along the path is controlled independently of the heading autopilot. The path-following controller is model based and a nonlinear hydrodynamic model is used to derive the motion control system. A ship case study using a scale model illustrates the path-following capabilities.},

	abstract = {Ship maneuvering models are the keys to the research of ship maneuverability, design of ship motion control system and development of ship handling simulators. For various frames of ship maneuvering models, determining the parameters of the models is always a tedious task. System identification theory can be used to establish system mathematical models by the system’s input data and output data. In this paper, based on the analysis of ship hydrodynamics, a nonlinear model frame of ship maneuvering is established. System identification theory is employed to estimate the parameters of the model. An algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter theory is proposed to calculate the parameters. In order to gain the system’s input and output data, which is necessary for the parameters identification experiment, turning circle tests and Zig-zag tests are performed on shiphandling simulator and the initial data is collected. Based on the Fixed Interval Kalman Smoothing algorithm, a pre-processing algorithm is proposed to process the raw data of the tests. With this algorithm, the errors introduced during the measurement process are eliminated. Parameters identification experiments are designed to estimate the model parameters, and the ship maneuvering model parameters estimation algorithm is extended to modify the parameters being estimated. Then the model parameters and the ship maneuvering model are determined. Simulation validation was carried out to simulate the ship maneuverability. Comparisons have been made to the simulated data and measured data. The results show that the ship maneuvering model determined by our approach can seasonably reflect the actual motion of ship, and the parameter estimation procedure and algorithms are effective.},

Aiming at the inconvenience of obtaining model parameters under the traditional experimental method, this article studies the parameter identification of unmanned marine vehicle’s manoeuvring model based on extended Kalman filter and support vector machine. Firstly, the second-order nonlinear manoeuvring response model of unmanned marine vehicle is discretized by the difference method, and the corresponding data are collected by the manoeuvring motion simulation of the response model. Secondly, the discrete response model is transformed into an augmented state vector based on extended Kalman filter, and the optimal estimation of the state vector is calculated to identify the parameters. And then, the discrete response model is transformed into a support vector machine-based regression model, the collected data are processed and a set of support vectors are obtained to further identify the parameters of the response model. Finally, by comparing the simulation experiments’ results from the original model and the identification model, the recognition results-based extended Kalman filter and support vector machine are analysed and some research results are obtained. The results of this article will provide a powerful reference for the design of unmanned marine vehicle’s motion control algorithm.},

cause in the field of statistical learning. To diminish the
parameter drift and identify the model parameters more
accurately, a better understanding of the characteristics of
collinearity is necessary. System identification is one of the
effective modeling methods in the study of ship
manoeuvrability. This paper aims at quantifying and analyzing
the collinearity in the modeling of ship manoeuvring motion by
using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). By utilizing the multiple
datasets including those from zigzag and turning tests and the
combinations of manoeuvres, as well as the data processed by
D-optimizing design or difference method, the VIF is applied to
quantify the severity of collinearity of different model
structures. The results show that the selected manoeuvring
models have high collinearity under the data of single standard
manoeuvre. The pre-processed test data and an appropriate
model structure can alleviate the collinearity, hence to diminish the parameter drift. However, the collinearity of the selected
models cannot be eliminated. Some suggestions are given for
selecting more appropriate training data and mathematical
model structures of ship manoeuvring to accurately estimate the
model parameters.},

	abstract = {Small USVs are usually equipped with a low-cost navigation sensor suite consisting of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver and a magnetic compass. Unfortunately, the magnetic compass is highly susceptible to electromagnetic disturbances. Hence, it should not be used in safety-critical autopilot systems. A gyrocompass, however, is highly reliable, but it is too expensive for most USV systems. It is tempting to compute the heading angle by using two GNSS antennas on the same receiver. Unfortunately, for small USV systems, the distance between the antennas is very small, requiring that an RTK GNSS receiver is used. The drawback of the RTK solution is that it suffers from dropouts due to ionospheric disturbances, multipath, interference, etc. For safety-critical applications, a more robust approach is to estimate the course angle to avoid using the heading angle during path following. The main result of this article is a five-state extended Kalman filter (EKF) aided by GNSS latitude-longitude measurements for estimation of the course over ground (COG), speed over ground (SOG), and course rate. These are the primary signals needed to implement a course autopilot system onboard a USV. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and easy to implement since only four EKF covariance parameters must be specified. The parameters need to be calibrated for different GNSS receivers and vehicle types, but they are not sensitive to the working conditions. Another advantage of the EKF is that the autopilot does not need to use the COG and SOG measurements from the GNSS receiver, which have varying quality and reliability. It is also straightforward to add complementary sensors such as a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) to the EKF to improve the performance further. Finally, the performance of the five-state EKF is demonstrated by experimental testing of two commercial USV systems.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a complete procedure for sensor compatibility correction of a fixed-wing Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV). The sensors consist of a differential air pressure transducer for airspeed measurement, two airdata vanes installed on an airdata probe for angle of attack (AoA) and angle of sideslip (AoS) measurement, and an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) that provides attitude angles, angular rates, and acceleration. The procedure is mainly based on a two pass algorithm called the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother, which consists of a forward pass Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a backward recursion smoother. On top of that, this paper proposes the implementation of the Wiener Type Filter prior to the RTS in order to avoid the complicated process noise covariance matrix estimation. Furthermore, an easy to implement airdata measurement noise variance estimation method is introduced. The method estimates the airdata and subsequently the noise variances using the ground speed and ascent rate provided by the Global Positioning System (GPS). It incorporates the idea of data regionality by assuming that some sort of statistical relation exists between nearby data points. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) is being employed to justify the sensor compatibility. The result shows that the presented procedure is easy to implement and it improves the UAV sensor data compatibility significantly.},

We propose to significantly reduce this burden by maintaining a single source document in a version-controlled environment (such as git), adding functionality to generate a collection of output formats popular in academia. To this end, we utilise various open-source tools from the Jupyter scientific computing ecosystem and operationalise selected software engineering concepts. We offer a proof-of-concept workflow that composes Jupyter Book (an online document), Jupyter Notebook (a computational narrative) and reveal.js slides from a single markdown source file. Hosted on GitHub, our approach supports change tracking and versioning, as well as a transparent review process based on the underlying code issue management infrastructure.

RDE had emerged earlier in the study of the second variations in the calculus of variations, but its use in general linear systems, where the optimal trajectory needs to be generated by a control input, was new. The analysis throughout the paper concentrates on timevarying systems, and uses the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to arrive at RDE and to deduce optimality of the LQ control gain. We now know, however, that an alternative way to prove optimality in least squares is by showing how RDE allows one to "complete the square" (see, e.g., [5], [18]).},

The free running manoeuvre at the different time steps were also simulated. The yaw checking ability and the turning ability of KVLCC2 were predicted using CFD and could have been confirmed that the IMO criteria was satisfied. When the results were compared with the model test and system-based method, the free running simulation showed better agreement to that of the model test.

For the KVLCC test case, two stern shape variants named KVLCC1 and KVLCC2 giving different instability loops were included. Free model test data was compared with systems-based methods and CFD for specified free maneuvers. Some of the systems-based methods used provided PMM and CMT data, and two used CFD instead. CFD-based methods were used to simulate forced motions and were compared with PMM/CMT model test data. The submissions were blind in the sense that the benchmark model test data was not provided prior to the workshop, unless data was required as input to the simulation method. A total of 64 submissions were received for the free maneuver simulations, which included a wide range of the state-of-the-art methods in use today, such as PMM- and CMT-based methods, CFD based methods, system identification, neural network tools and various empirical methods. For the forced motion simulations a total of 16 submissions were received, comprising different CFD-based methods such as RANS, URANS, and DES.

Gaussian process is adopted as the surrogate model to estimate the unobserved validation errors, and lower confidence bound is adopted for trading off exploration and exploitation in the process of optimization. Taking the KVLCC2 ship as the study object, the experimental data provided by Hamburg Ship Model Basin is utilized for modeling and validation of prediction, and the detailed procedures to prepare and preprocess the input-output data are discussed. After well designed and trained, the selected neural network model is evaluated by the prediction results of ship maneuvers in comparison with the experimental data.

	abstract = {Parameter drift is a tricky problem in system identification, and collinearity in the identified model is considered to be its
cause in the field of statistical learning. To diminish the
parameter drift and identify the model parameters more
accurately, a better understanding of the characteristics of
collinearity is necessary. System identification is one of the
effective modeling methods in the study of ship
manoeuvrability. This paper aims at quantifying and analyzing
the collinearity in the modeling of ship manoeuvring motion by
using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). By utilizing the multiple
datasets including those from zigzag and turning tests and the
combinations of manoeuvres, as well as the data processed by
D-optimizing design or difference method, the VIF is applied to
quantify the severity of collinearity of different model
structures. The results show that the selected manoeuvring
models have high collinearity under the data of single standard
manoeuvre. The pre-processed test data and an appropriate
model structure can alleviate the collinearity, hence to diminish the parameter drift. However, the collinearity of the selected
models cannot be eliminated. Some suggestions are given for
selecting more appropriate training data and mathematical
model structures of ship manoeuvring to accurately estimate the
model parameters.},

	abstract = {A certain class of methods to select suitable models of dynamical stochastic systems from measured input-output data is considered. The methods are based on a comparison between the measured outputs and the outputs of a candidate model. Depending on the set of models that is used, such methods are known under a variety of names, like output-error methods, equation-error methods, maximum-likelihood methods, etc. General results are proved concerning the models that are selected asymptotically as the number of observed data tends to infinity. For these results it is not assumed that the true system necessarily can be exactly represented within the chosen set of models. In the particular case when the model set contains the system, general consistency results are obtained and commented upon. Rather than to seek an exact description of the system, it is usually more realistic to be content with a suitable approximation of the true system with reasonable complexity properties. Here, the consequences of such a viewpoint are discussed.},

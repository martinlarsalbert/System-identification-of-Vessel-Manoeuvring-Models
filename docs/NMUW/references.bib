	abstract = {Partial least squares (PLS) regression is used for identifying the hydrodynamic derivatives in the Abkowitz model for ship maneuvering motion. To identify the dynamic characteristics in ship maneuvering motion, the derivatives of hydrodynamic model's outputs are set as the target output of the PLS identification model. To verify the effectiveness of PLS parametric identification method in processing data with high dimensionality and heavy multicollinearity, the identified results of the hydrodynamic derivatives from the simulated 20 deg/20 deg zigzag test are compared with the planar motion mechanism (PMM) test results. The performance of PLS regression is also compared with that of the conventional least squares (LS) regression using the same dataset. Simulation results show the satisfactory identification and generalization performances of PLS regression and its superiority in comparison with the LS method, which demonstrates its capability in processing measurement data with high dimensionality and heavy multicollinearity, especially in processing data with small sample size.},

In this study, the dynamic response of floating bridges under such loadings is investigated. A floating bridge concept, which consists of two cable-stayed spans and 19 continuous spans, is selected. An eigenvalue analysis is first conducted and it is found that the period of the first mode is typically in the order of one minute or more. This implies that the amplified response effect should also be evaluated for the second-order wave load in addition to the first-order wave load. By performing a nonlinear time domain dynamic analysis, the bridge dynamic responses from wind and wave loadings are obtained. The effects of the wind load, first-order and second-order wave loads are studied considering different load combinations. Structural responses including girder displacements, accelerations and moments are investigated for each load combination.},

	abstract = {Modern volume carriers such as container vessels, cruise ships and Pure Car and Truck Carriers (PCTC’s) have become more vulnerable to critical roll responses as built in margins have been traded against increased transport efficiency. The research presented in this doctoral thesis aims at enhancing the predictability and control of these critical roll responses. The thesis presents a holistic framework for predicting and assessing the roll damping, which is a crucial parameter for predicting roll motions, based on a unique combination of full scale trials, model tests, semi-empirical methods and computational fluid dynamics. The framework is intended to be used from the early design stage and gradually improved until delivery of the ship and finally to provide input for decision support in the operation. The thesis also includes a demonstration of a new application for rudder control to be used for mitigation of parametric roll. This is performed by simulating real incidents that have occurred with PCTC’s in service. Simulations with rudder roll control show promising results and reveal that the approach could be very efficient for mitigation of parametric roll. Finally, an approach for monitoring of roll induced stresses, so-called racking stresses in PCTC’s, is presented. The approach involves measurement of the ship motions and scaling of pre-calculated structural responses from global finite element analysis. Based on full scale motion and stress measurements from a PCTC in-service the approach is evaluated and demonstrated to be an efficient alternative to conventional methods.},

Using the method, the roll damping of various ship hulls with various bilge keels are calculated to investigate its characteristics. Ship hull forms are systematically changed by changing length, beam, draft, midship sectional coefficient and prismatic coefficient. On the basis of these predicted roll damping of various ships, a very simple prediction formula of the roll damping of ships is deduced.

	abstract = {The nonlinear responses of ship rolling motion characterized by a roll damping moment are of great interest to naval architects and ocean engineers. Modeling and identification of the nonlinear damping moment are essential to incorporate the inherent nonlinearity in design, analysis, and control of a ship. A stochastic nonparametric approach for identification of nonlinear damping in the general mechanical system has been presented in the literature (Han and Kinoshits 2012). The method has been also applied to identification of the nonlinear damping moment of a ship at zero-forward speed (Han and Kinoshits 2013). In the presence of forward speed, however, the characteristic of roll damping moment of a ship is significantly changed due to the lift effect. In this paper, the stochastic inverse method is applied to identification of the nonlinear damping moment of a ship moving at nonzero-forward speed. The workability and validity of the method are verified with laboratory tests under controlled conditions. In experimental trials, two different types of ship rolling motion are considered: time-dependent transient motion and frequency-dependent periodic motion. It is shown that this method enables the inherent nonlinearity in damping moment to be estimated, including its reliability analysis.},

Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The methodology to obtain the non-linear roll damping from decay tests is very old. It has been proposed by Froude in the 19th century and used from then on. Behind it there is a quadratic model ⎡⎣θ  θ  ⎦⎤ for the damping and a subsequent equivalent linearization. Probably all model basin in the world follows this approach to assess the damping from a decay test. This is well documented and so is the methods to get the p1-p2 coefficients. This is very general in the sense that in principle, it could be applied to any kind of hull. However, it has become clear that for hull with a flat bottom such as a very large crude carrier (VLCC), this approach may lead to confusing results such as negative p2. Faced with this, the work presents a completely new idea. Avoiding the polynomial approximation, the basic attitude is to devise two regions from the decaying test response. The first, called the large amplitude response region yields a larger damping, probably due to the large bilge keel vortices that are attracted to the hull flat bottom. The second is the small amplitude response region where the vortices are not attracted to the bottom but travels approximately 45º sidewise. These observations has led to a new approach called the bi-linear approach as discussed in the work after analyzing several (many) model test results. In fact, a new modified bi-linear approach is ultimately proposed after the understanding of a transition region instead of a transition angle.},

	abstract = {For a large ﬂoating structure in waves, the damping is computed by the linear diffraction/radiation theory. For most degrees of freedom, this radiation damping is adequate for an accurate prediction of the rigid body motions of the structure at the wave frequencies. This is not particularly true for the roll motion of a long ﬂoating structure. For ships, barges and similar long offshore structures, the roll damping is highly nonlinear. In these cases the radiation damping is generally quite small compared to the total damping in the system. Moreover, the dynamic ampliﬁcation in roll may be large for such structures since the roll natural period generally falls within the frequency range of a typical wave energy spectrum experienced by them. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that a good estimate of the roll damping is made for such structures. The actual prediction of roll damping is a difﬁcult analytical task. The nonlinear components of roll damping are determined from model and full scale experiments. This paper examines the roll damping components and their empirical contributions. These empirical expressions should help the designer of such ﬂoating structures. The numerical values of roll damping components of typical ships and barges in waves and current (or forward speed) are presented. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this work a combined analytical-numerical approach is proposed to address the problem of the ship roll motion under the combined action of wind and waves. Roll motion is modelled as a one-degree-of-freedom system non-linear in both damping and restoring. The approach is modular, allowing an easy update of the methodology on the basis of new research outcomes. Realistic environmental conditions regarding the effects of both wind and waves are taken into account and can be easily changed. The spatial correlation of wind gusts is taken into account by means of an 'aerodynamic admittance' function, whereas the moment due to waves is obtained from the sea slope spectrum using the concept of effective wave slope, leading to a 'hydrodynamic admittance' function. Both static and dynamic aspects of the problems are taken into account. The proposed analytical procedure, based on statistical linearization technique, allows approximate statistical averages of the roll motion, assumed to be Gaussian, to be obtained without necessarily resorting to time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. On the basis of the results obtained, an estimation of the capsize probability can be carried out. It seems that the effect of wind gustiness could be considered very small when compared with the effects of waves and mean wind speed when the metacentric height is sufficiently large. Finally, the presented approach moves towards the concept of 'performance-based analysis', recently introduced at the International Maritime Organization as the basis for future developments of intact stability, in a clear and formal way.},

	abstract = {We numerically studied the full (six degrees of freedom) motion of a cargo ship without roll stabilizers in rough (sea state 5) conditions for multiple heading angles ranging from 0° (follower seas) to 180° (head seas). We found that the ship exhibits excessive roll motion in quartering (45° off the stern), beam, and head seas. Therefore, roll damping is critical in these conditions. We then investigated the performance of passive and active anti-roll tank (ART) systems and compared their performance in each of the three sea conditions. Each ART consists of three identical tanks, distributed along the centerline of the ship, each of which consists of two vertical ducts connected at the bottom with a horizontal duct. A pump is located at the middle of the horizontal duct of each tank. The pumps are switched on for active ARTs but switched off for passive ones. The loads (forces and moments) exerted on the ship by the ARTs are added to the hydrodynamic loads (e.g., due to pressure and viscous effects) and the thrust in the governing equations of motion of the ship. Whereas both passive and active ARTs are able to reduce the excessive roll motion, active ARTs outperform the passive ones from three perspectives. First, they are more effective in reducing the roll motion. Second, they require much less working liquid. Third, their performance is insensitive to their natural frequencies and, hence, to their geometric design. In addition, we found that head seas are most responsive to ARTs, which suggests that they are effective in mitigating parametric roll. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ship motions in a high sea state can have adverse effects on controllability, cause loss of stability, and ultimately compromise the survivability of the ship. In a broaching event, the ship losses control, naturally turning broadside to the waves, causing a dangerous situation and possibly capsizing. Classical approaches to study broaching rely on costly experimental programs and/or time-domain potential or system-based simulation codes. In this paper the ability of Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) to simulate a broaching event in irregular waves is demonstrated, and the extensive information available is used to analyze the broaching process. The demonstration nature of this paper is stressed, as opposed to a validated study. Unsteady RANS (URANS) provides a model based on first principles to capture phenomena such as coupling between sway, yaw, and roll, roll damping, effects of complex waves on righting arm, rudders partially out of the water, etc. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method uses a single-phase level-set approach to model the free surface, and dynamic overset grids to resolve large-amplitude motions. Before evaluating irregular seas two regular wave cases are demonstrated, one causing broaching and one causing stable surf riding. A sea state 8 is imposed following an irregular Bretschneider spectrum, and an autopilot was implemented to control heading and speed with two different gains for the heading controller. It is concluded that the autopilot causes the ship to be in an adverse dynamic condition at the beginning of the broaching process, and thus is partially responsible for the occurrence of the broaching event. © 2008 JASNAOE.},

Although the method is expressible to contain any order of the perturbing term, a single degree is chosen to avoid cumbersome mathematical complexity. In order to improve the solution a first-order correction term is also included. Moreover, a numerical example is carried out for a small vessel in order to validate the solution scheme.},

The calculation of the time variations of the restoring force is made using a pressure integration technique over the instantaneous submerged hull. Hydrodynamic effects are based on a potential flow strip theory using Frank′s Close fit method. A semi-empirical formulation is adopted for the surge motion. Different models for roll damping have been introduced so far in the governing equations but in the present case roll damping is determined directly from experimental data that includes roll decay tests with different forward speed, which allows the assessment of the effect of ship speed on roll damping.

The ship section is allowed to oscillate in three degrees of freedom: Sway, heave and roll. We investigate in particular the damping caused by flow separation from the bilge keels. This has importance near resonance. The investigation is carried out by means of model tests as well as by a linear wavetank and a fully nonlinear numerical wavetank. Both are time-domain wavetanks based on a Boundary Element Method (BEM) and the mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian (MEL) formalism. Flow separation is modelled in the nonlinear numerical wavetank by means of an inviscid vortex tracking method. We focus on the, under resonant condition, large-amplitude massive piston-like fluid motion in between the ship and the terminal and the associated large ship motions. We do not focus on the sloshing problem associated with higher modes. In resonant condition, large piston-mode motion occurs when the sway and heave motions are downwards and towards the terminal simultaneously.An alternative formulation of the forces and moment is derived and implemented into the nonlinear numerical wavetank as a means to circumvent the problems related to the, term in the Bernoulli equation in the presently adopted MEL approach. © 2010.},

	doi = {10.1115/1.3101710},
	abstract = {The mechanics of ship capsize under steady and transient conditions is reviewed, focusing on recent applications of global geometrical techniques of nonlinear dynamics. These yield significant new ideas about capsize in waves and its generalization, the escape of a driven oscillator from a potential well. These ideas are robust against gross changes in the forms of the stiffness and damping functions. Fractal basin boundaries in phase and control space yield useful design criteria against transient capsize, which have been applied to real ships. Invariant manifolds are used to explain and predict the sudden loss of safe basin in the space of the starting conditions, and indeterminate resonant jumps to capsize. Further work is concerned with capsize suppression by heave-roll coupling; effects of parametric excitation; and capsize under a propagating wave front. After this historical review, the practical relevance of the results is assessed, and suggestions are made for a standardized transient testing procedure for hulls. A systematic formulation for rolling in beam waves, employing the effective gravitational field perpendicular to the wave surface and the Froude-Krilov assumption, allows the use of the calmwater GZ curve. With general stiffness and damping functions, dimensional analysis offers insights that are often overlooked: for example, the sustainable wave slope is always proportional to the angle of vanishing stability. A degree of quantification is provided by a design formula derived from the displacement magnification of linear resonance. This is validated by Melnikov theory and simulation. It predicts that under worst-case excitation we have: sustainable wave slope = 2ζθv, where θv is the angle of vanishing stability and ζ is a damping ratio appropriate for heavy roll. So in ocean waves of slope 0.5 (≈30°), a vessel with a θv of one radian needs a damping ratio of about 1/4. Implications for the design of hulls reveal counter-intuitive results: it is the distance of the potential barrier, not its height, that prevents escape or capsize. The formula helps to define a universal capsize diagram. New results on symmetry breaking are finally presented. These show that capsize studies of a symmetric unbiased vessel can give seriously unsafe results. The sustainable wave slope is so sensitive to a symmetry-breaking bias (due to wind or cargo imbalance) that a static heel of 2.5° can halve the sustainable slope over a wide range of sea states.

	abstract = {For a large floating structure in waves, the damping is computed by the linear diffraction/radiation theory. For most degrees of freedom, this radiation damping is adequate for an accurate prediction of the rigid body motions of the structure at the wave frequencies. This is not particularly true for the roll motion of a long floating structure. For ships, barges and similar long offshore structures, the roll damping is highly nonlinear. In these cases the radiation damping is generally quite small compared to the total damping in the system. More over, the dynamic amplification in roll may be large for such structures since the roll natural period generally falls within the frequency range of a typical wave energy spectrum experienced by them. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that a good estimate of the roll damping is made for such structures. The actual prediction of roll damping is a difficult analytical task. The nonlinear components of roll damping are determined from model and full scale experiments. This paper examines the roll damping components and their empirical contributions. These empirical expressions should help the designer of such floating structures. The numerical values of roll damping components of typical ships and barges in waves and current (or forward speed) are presented. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An extension of the LQR/LQG methodology to systems with saturating actuators, referred to as SLQR/SLQG, where S stands for saturating, is obtained. The development is based on the method of stochastic linearization, whereby the saturation is replaced by a gain, calculated as a function of the variance of the signal at its input. Using the stochastically linearized system and the Lagrange multiplier technique, solutions of the SLQR/SLQG problems are derived. These solutions are given by standard Riccati and Lyapunov equations coupled with two transcendental equations, which characterize both the variance of the signal at the saturation input and the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constrained minimization problem. It is shown that, under standard stabilizability and detectability conditions, these equations have a unique solution, which can be found by a simple bisection algorithm. When the level of saturation tends to infinity, these equations reduce to their standard LQR/LQG counterparts. In addition, the paper investigates the properties of closed-loop systems with SLQR/SLQG controllers and saturating actuators. In this regard, it is shown that SLQR/SLQG controllers ensure semi-global stability by appropriate choice of a parameter in the performance criterion. Finally, the paper illustrates the techniques developed by a ship roll damping problem.},

	volume = {40},
	abstract = {In October 1998 a post-Panamax C11 class containership encountered extreme weather and sustained extensive loss and damage to deck stowed containers. The motions of the vessel during this storm event were investigated through a series of model tests and numerical analyses that confirmed the vessel's parametric rolling response in head seas at the time of the casualty. These studies provide insight into the conditions in which post-Panamax containerships are likely to experience head sea parametric rolling, and the magnitude of motions and accelerations that can occur. The findings from this investigation are presented in this paper, together with discussion of how such extreme motions impact the design and application of container securing systems. Also outlined in the paper are recommendations for additional research needed to better understand the influence of vessel design and operational considerations on the propensity of post-Panamax containerships towards parametric rolling. This investigation and other recent studies demonstrate that parametric roll in extreme head or near head seas an occur when unfavorable tuning is combined with low roll damping (reduced speed) and large stability variations (governed by wavelength, wave height, general hull form, bow flare, and stern shapes). Parametric rolling is an unstable phenomenon, which can quickly generate large roll angles that are coupled with significant pitch motions. The rolling occurs in phase with pitch, and on containerships introduces high loads into the containers and their securing systems. It appears that post-Panamax containerships may be particularly prone to this behavior. This is an important issue considering the large number of these vessels scheduled for delivery in the next few years.},

For volume carriers the hull lift and bilge keel components are the dominating components and the estimation of these components in the original method are benchmarked and scrutinized. It is concluded that the speed dependence of the bilge keels damping is underestimated by the original method. This is partially explained by that Ikeda seems to have underestimated the lift force of the bilge keels in his analytical expressions. Correcting for this and taking account of the lift force-generated pressure on the hull surface gives overall better agreement with model tests. It is also concluded that the hull lift damping component is significantly overestimated with the original method. Non-viscid CFD is used to propose a new generic expression for estimating the lift coefficients for volume carriers which greatly improve the accuracy in comparison to model test results. With these improvements Ikeda’s method is revitalized and the applicability is extended to unconventional volume carriers.},

	abstract = {We present a modular mathematical model and a reference technique for the rapid estimation of maneuvering trajectories and motion time histories of single- and twin-screw propulsion ships. Heave, roll and pitch radiation damping are estimated from a non-linear unified seakeeping/maneuvering time-domain tool using numerical decay tests and then implemented to a 6–DoF model in the form of critical damping and natural period. Short waves are idealised by numerical integration along the vessel’s waterline profile and associated hydrodynamic actions are implemented in a response curve format. For the rapid assessment of hull in-plane hydrodynamic forces, derivatives are implemented via semi-empirical methods, CFD or model test data. Results are validated against experiments available for zig-zag and turning cycle trajectories of vessels with different hull forms and propulsion configurations. It is concluded that the approach presented is feasible for the prediction of maneu­ vering trajectories of existing or new-build vessels and for estimating the evasive velocity in way of contact before grounding.},

	abstract = {Having an accurate prediction of ship roll damping is crucial when analysing roll motions. In this paper, the simplified Ikeda method (SI-method) is compared with the original Ikeda method. The methods are compared using results from a database of roll decay tests carried out on modern merchant ships and a smaller set of predictions in which the original Ikeda method was used. It was found that most of the ships in the database had dimensions outside the limits of the SI-method. Thus, the SI-method showed poor agreement with model tests outside its limits but acceptable agreement for ships within limits. It was found that the deviations were caused by extrapolation errors of the wave-damping in the SI-method. Two ways to improve the accuracy of the SI-method were proposed based on regression, which gave about the same accuracy as the original Ikeda method.},

Recent work has shown that the applicability and accuracy of Ikeda's method for modern hull forms are somewhat uncertain which is very unfortunate, especially for analysis of parametric roll. This paper investigates the accuracy of the simplified Ikeda's method for modern ships, by comparison with roll damping coefficients obtained from a large number of roll decay model tests. Possible ways to improve the accuracy of semi-empirical predictions of roll damping for modern ships is also investigated in this paper.},

	abstract = {Virtual prototypes (VPs) are digital models that mock-up existing or conceptual systems' behaviour. In offshore operations, VPs find usages in design, proof of concept for new equipment or method, control system testing, procedure planning, and expert crew training. Moreover, VP can be used in full mission simulators with crews of maritime and offshore engineers, in which case they integrate with control systems such as handles and dynamic positioning systems. Putting the human in the loop sets high requirements for the fidelity of the visual 3D-models and the mathematical models' validity. VPs are thus time-consuming to create and difficult to validate, even based on an existing offshore system. This paper presents an innovative framework for rapid virtual prototyping of ships for hardware and human in the loop simulations and validates the results with data gathered in a sea trial performed on a research vessel, with satisfying results for position keeping.Abbreviations: CLI, Command line interpreter; DP, Dynamic positioning system: ship equipment used to maintain position and heading; DM, Damping matrix; Force FBK, Force Feedback Thruster1; HIL, Hardware in the loop; HITL, Human in the loop; JNI, Java native interface; LC, Loading condition; RAO, Response amplitude operator; RPM, Revolutions per minute; RPM FBK, RPM Feedback Thruster2/3 (Main/Azimuth); SCM, Source code management system; SOG, Speed over ground; VP, Virtual prototyping/prototype; VST, Virtual sea trial; sea trial performed in a simulation},

	abstract = {A lot of simulation methods based on Maneuvering Modeling Group (MMG) model for ship maneuvering have been presented. Many simulation methods sometimes harm the adaptability of hydrodynamic force data for the maneuvering simulations since one method may be not applicable to other method in general. To avoid this, basic part of the method should be common. Under such a background, research committee on “standardization of mathematical model for ship maneuvering predictions” was organized by the Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers and proposed a prototype of maneuvering prediction method for ships, called “MMG standard method”. In this article, the MMG standard method is introduced. The MMG standard method is composed of 4 elements; maneuvering simulation model, procedure of the required captive model tests to capture the hydrodynamic force characteristics, analysis method for determining the hydrodynamic force coefficients for maneuvering simulations, and prediction method for maneuvering motions of a ship in fullscale. KVLCC2 tanker is selected as a sample ship and the captive mode test results are presented with a process of the data analysis. Using the hydrodynamic force coefficients presented, maneuvering simulations are carried out for KVLCC2 model and the fullscale ship for validation of the method. The present method can roughly capture the maneuvering motions and is useful for the maneuvering predictions in fullscale.},

The sailing hybrid ship will operate with leeway (drift) angles to produce a lateral force known as sideforce, for steady operation under sail. In this paper, experimental results for the sailing performance of ships fitted with bilge keel appendages are presented. Systematic variations in appendage height, length, and position were tested, including several special cases (multiple bilge keels). The appendage typology is shown to mitigate the strong ‘destabilizing’ yaw moment that is characteristic of wind-assisted commercial vessels and to promote the non-linear sideforce component. The working principal for bilge keels—promotion of flow separation—can be employed to specify the separation location for components of the vessel vortex wake to improve the sailing performance of the ship.},

	doi = {10.2534/jjasnaoe1952.1957.102_115},
	abstract = {The resistance to rolling is of great importance to investigate the safety of vessels in rough seas. The passive resistance due to the action of the water is mainly composed of three kinds, i.e., the frictional resistance, the eddy making resistance and the wave making resistance Of these resistances only the wave making one was shown in the author's previous paper to follow the law of comparison for similar ships. It is therefore necessary to establish formulae for the frictional and eddy making resistances in order to extend the results of model experiments to actual ships.In the present paper new formulae for the frictional resistance are obtained after analysing the results of experiments on the oscillations of suspended cylinders wholly immersed in the water. The frictional coefficient Cf for oscillating cylinders is found to be expressed in the form exactly same as that given by H. Blasius for laminar flow, if Reynolds number Rn be taken as 3.22r2θm2/Tv The decrement of roll per swing due to friction for a ship model without bilge keels in fresh water is given by the formula dθf=2.11Srs2θm/WmT1.5 at 15°C in kg, m, sec, deg, units : and the decrement for a ship model with bilge keels is written as dθf=2.11Srs2θm/WmT1.5 \{1+0.143 (rsθm) 0.772/T0.386\} at 15°C.in which the frictional coefficient for turbulent flow is used from the following formula given by G. Hughes Cf= 1.328Rn-0.5 + 0.014Rn-0.114. The value of δθf for a ship in salt water is shown as dθf=2.22Srs2θm/WmT1.5 \{1+0.141 (rsθm) 0.772/T0.386\} at 15°C.Though the mean radius rs for the wetted surface may be calculated by using the formula rs=√1/S∫∫r2sin2αdldx, it is easily and in close approximation obtained from the following formula rs=1/π \{(0. 877+ 0.145Cb) (1.7 d+ Cb·B) -2×OG\}, where Cb is the block coefficient, d the mean draught, B the breadth of ship and OG the value of (d-KG).The ratio of δθf to the total decrement δθ at the mean angle of roll of 5 degrees for ordinary ship models 2 m in length is ranging from about 7 to 16 per cent, while the ratio at the mean angle of roll of 20 degrees is from 3 to 7 per cent. This ratio for actual ships is found to be between one tenth and one fifth of that of ship models.},

This survey reviews publications, commercial software and simulators, and regulations on offshore operations. Findings indicate that the VPOO is not common in the industry, offshore operation regulations lag behind the state of the art in industry in terms of mission planning, and this field has been subject to scarce commercial and scientific scrutiny so far.

	abstract = {Study and analysis of container ship roll motions in adverse weather conditions remains an important issue for research in maritime industry as this aspect continue to expose the ships to dangerous situations that leads to loss of ships and cargoes. Once high and dangerous roll motions are developed, especially by the ships with large flares fore and aft, as container ships, it generates accelerations in the lashing equipment that exceeds the threshold values, leading to collapse of container stows as well as loos of containers overboard. In this paper is presented the results of the analysis of a container ship roll motions in adverse weather conditions in a particular area of navigation from North Atlantic Ocean. The analysis is based on a real case scenario of a container ship casualty occurred in a very common navigation route, generated by high roll motions and resulted in the collapse of container stows and a massive loss of containers overboard. The aim of this paper is to identify the causes and analyse the factors that generated the dangerous situation and the casualty. The simulations carried out and presented in this paper were performed by using the OCTOPUS Office 6 (AMARCON) software that can reveal the response on the ship in modelled energy spectrum environmental conditions. The results will lead to a better understanding of the root causes that generated the exposure of the ship to such dangerous situation and can be used as recommendations in order to avoid similar situations in the future.},

	abstract = {The prediction of the behavior of ships in a seaway has been an important topic in ship design since the beginning of modern naval architecture. In recent years, computer simulations using numerical methods based on mathematical models of the ship hydrodynamics problem has become a valuable tool for researchers and engineers working in this field. A large variety of methods with different levels of sophistication and accuracy already exist today, all being suitable for specific problems. However, with the current trend of larger, more advanced and optimized designs and focus turning more and more towards safety and energy efficiency, nonlinear phenomena are becoming more important and many of the traditional methods have problems in producing accurate results for certain cases due to assumptions and neglected physical effects in the underlying mathematical model. The overall objective of this project is the development and implementation of a fully nonlinear unsteady three-dimensional boundary element method for ship motion analysis, applicable to problems with a high degree of nonlinearities while still being suitable for practical use. The method is capable of predicting wave induced loads and motions with actual forward speed, taking into account implicitly all kinds of nonlinearities, i.e. higher and lower order frequency components, hull shape above the calm water level and self interaction between the forward speed flow field as well as radiated and diffracted waves. This thesis presents the mathematical model, the numerical method and numerical results obtained from the application of the method to a number of relevant test cases. Results from the application of the method are provided, including the propagation of a regular long-crested wave, the wave resistance problem in calm water and the radiation and diffraction problem in regular and irregular head sea. The results are limited to heave and pitch motions and are compared with analytical or experimental data, numerical results from other methods or, in some cases, both. The method has proved to be able to capture strong nonlinear effects in heave and pitch motions and its feasibility as a qualified analysis tool for such cases has been demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Plunging breakers are beyond the reach of all known analytical approximations. Previous numerical computations have succeeded only in integrating the equations of motion up to the instant when the surface becomes vertical. In this paper we present a new method for following the time-history of space-periodic irrotational surface waves. The only independent variables are the coordinates and velocity potential of marked particles at the free surface. At each time-step an integral equation is solved for the new normal component of velocity. The method is faster and more accurate than previous methods based on a two dimensional grid. It has also the advantage that the marked particles become concentrated near regions of sharp curvature. Viscosity and surface tension are both neglected. The method is tested on a free, steady wave of finite amplitude, and is found to give excellent agreement with independent calculations based on Stokes’s series. It is then applied to unsteady waves, produced by initially applying an asymmetric distribution of pressure to a symmetric, progres­sive wave. The freely running wave then steepens and overturns. It is demonstrated that the surface remains rounded till well after the over­turning takes place.},

A Mariner Class vessel is taken as the study object. The time series used in training and testing the network is the simulated data of a series of maneuvers, which is obtained by numerically solving the Abkowitz model using fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. A three-layer neural network is built to solve this multivariable regression fitting problem, and only one network model is trained to predict various ship maneuvers. Taking the mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function, the network’s weights are optimized by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm effectively. The trained network is evaluated by several simulation tests, and it is shown that the network achieves good prediction ability and can predict the maneuvering motion as long as the control inputs and initial states of the ship motion are known.},

Forecasts of the vessels’ trajectories and motions are fundamentally based on the mathematical manoeuvring model, which is an essential component of their hydrodynamic digital twin nowadays. Using the benchmark container ship KCS as an object of study, this paper adopts a 4-DOF modular-type manoeuvring (MMG) model to predict the vessel trajectories in calm water and under the presence of steady current and regular waves. The current effects are treated as additional ship over water speed, while the wave effects are considered by superimposing the second-order mean wave drift loads to the calm water hull hydrodynamics. The wave drift loads are solved using the potential ﬂow solver WASIM, which is based on Rankine panel method. The computed vessel trajectories and motions are compared with available literature results and show good correlation.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the International Maritime Organization introduced a new set of rules in order to try to reduce emissions of ships by improving their eﬃciency. To assess the energy eﬃciency of a new ship, the regulations require to estimate the Energy Eﬃciency Design Index (EEDI), which represent the amount of Carbon Dioxide produced per mile in relation to the amount of cargo carried, and verify that it is smaller than a prescribed value. For a proper evaluation of the EEDI, it is necessary to estimate the added resistance in waves with high accuracy. There are diﬀerent ways to evaluate added resistance: empirical methods, adding a safety factor to the calm water resistance called sea margin, numerical simulations and model test experiments. Nowadays, the most used way during the design stage to do that is employing numerical simulations. Numerical simulations are not only used for the estimation of added resistance, but also to predict ship motions. If the motions are known at an early design stage, it is possible to modify the design of a ship to minimize them in order to improve the performance of the ship and to increase the safety and comfort of those who are on board.},

	abstract = {The steady rolling response in a regular beam sea of a 1:50 scale model of a destroyer in the bare hull condition has been studied. The restoring moment of the hull features strongly softening characteristics. This has led to the experimental evidence of bifurcations with jump in amplitude and phase during the tests at two different wave frequencies. The high quality measurements allowed the analysis of the gathered data through a single-degree-of-freedom roll motion equation. Exact numerical solutions have been used to obtain reliable values of the coefficients of the mathematical model to be used for the roll motion simulation. Approximate perturbative solutions have then been used to obtain a description of the domains of attraction of the system. An analysis of the stability of the steady state solutions in the range of frequencies where bifurcations and jumps were detected coupled with the analysis of the change of shape of the domains of attraction with the frequency allowed the differences found between the two physical situations to be explained.},

A method based on the 3-D CFD approach for calculating the roll damping of a ship is proposed in this paper. The free decay experiments of 4 different types of ships at zero velocity are carried out. The roll damping coefficients are calculated and compared with the experiment results, with a good agreement. It is shown that the method adopted in this paper could be used to simulate the free rolling of a ship in the calm water at zero velocity very well and with good, stable accuracy for the prediction of the roll damping, and also with good applicability. This method may be further developed for the prediction of a full scale ship in the future.},

	abstract = {Accurate calculation of the roll damping moment at resonance condition is essential for roll motion prediction. Because at the resonance condition, the moment of inertia counteracts restoring moment and only the damping moment resists increase in the roll angle. There are various methods to calculate the roll damping moment which are based on potential ﬂow theory. These methods have limitations to taking into account the viscous effects in estimating the roll motion, while, CFD as a numerical method is capable of considering the viscous effects. In this study, a CFD method based on a harmonic excited roll motion (HERM) technique is used to compute the roll motion and the roll damping moment of a containership’s model in different conditions. The inﬂuence of excitation frequency, forward speed and degrees of freedom at beam-sea and oblique-sea realizations are considered in estimating the roll damping coefﬁcients. The results are validated against model tests, where a good agreement is found.},

	abstract = {Proper estimation of roll damping moment is of paramount importance for adequate assessment of dynamic stability of ships. However, experimental data on roll damping of inland vessels are scarce and unreliable. Thus the applicability of classic Ikeda’s method and its simplified version on typical European inland vessels is investigated, with specific focus on eddy making component. It is found that the simplified Ikeda’s method, in comparison to the classic method, may considerably underestimate the eddy making component of damping of full hull forms, or even return negative values, although the block coefficient is within the limits of method applicability. Hence, the paper explores possibilities of adjusting the simplified Ikeda’s method in order to improve the observed shortcoming, as well as to extend its application to stability analysis of inland ships.},

Roll motion, course, and speed recorded during the events are presented and analyzed together with the present weather situation based on recordings, forecasts, and re-analysis. Different aspects of on-board operational guidance for assisting crews in avoiding parametric rolling are discussed in relation to the presented events.

For every ship that is to be tested an input file must be provided, containing the main particulars and information on the propulsion and steering system, together with an offset file describing her geometry. The experimental data as well should be set-up in an input file. The benchmark automatically creates input files for the chosen manoeuvring software, runs the software and manages the output files. It reads from these outputs, collects the model test measurements and plots the results. Some test-cases are presented in the paper, showing the potentialities and flexibility of the benchmark. To this purpose a manoeuvring prediction program is used as example and its theory briefly explained. Its simulations are then compared with the benchmark of experimental data.},

	abstract = {In many situations the manoeuvering performance of ships is largely effected by the non-linear contributions of the hydrodynamic reaction forces on the hull. The origin of these non-linear components can be ascertained from experiments with segmented models. In this paper a review is given of the analysis of the segmented model tests which have been reported in literature so far. From the results derived from this analysis it will be shown that the non-linear hull force and moment components can be described in a robust manner by means of a longitudinal distribution of the so-called cross-flow drag coefficient. Thus, a good description of the ship's manoeuvrability is acquired for the entire speed range of a vessel, including the transition from the manoeuvres at service speed with relatively small drift angles to the manoeuvres at reduced speed (harbour manoeuvering) with large drift angles.},

	abstract = {A lot of simulation methods based on Maneuvering Modeling Group (MMG) model for ship maneuvering have been presented. Many simulation methods sometimes harm the adaptability of hydrodynamic force data for the maneuvering simulations since one method may be not applicable to other method in general. To avoid this, basic part of the method should be common. Under such a background, research committee on ‘‘standardization of mathematical model for ship maneuvering predictions’’ was organized by the Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers and proposed a prototype of maneuvering prediction method for ships, called ‘‘MMG standard method’’. In this article, the MMG standard method is introduced. The MMG standard method is composed of 4 elements; maneuvering simulation model, procedure of the required captive model tests to capture the hydrodynamic force characteristics, analysis method for determining the hydrodynamic force coefﬁcients for maneuvering simulations, and prediction method for maneuvering motions of a ship in fullscale. KVLCC2 tanker is selected as a sample ship and the captive mode test results are presented with a process of the data analysis. Using the hydrodynamic force coefﬁcients presented, maneuvering simulations are carried out for KVLCC2 model and the fullscale ship for validation of the method. The present method can roughly capture the maneuvering motions and is useful for the maneuvering predictions in fullscale.},

Application of the algorithm to a set of simulated data has proved to be quite successful.

	abstract = {The main objective of this study is to investigate the turning and zig-zag maneuvering performance of the well-known naval surface combatant DTMB (David Taylor Model Basin) 5415 hull with URANS (Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) method. Numerical simulations of static drift tests have been performed by a commercial RANS solver based on a finite volume method (FVM) in an unsteady manner. The fluid flow is considered as 3-D, incompressible and fully turbulent. Hydrodynamic analyses have been carried out for a fixed Froude number 0.28. During the analyses, the free surface effects have been taken into account using VOF (Volume of Fluid) method and the hull is considered as fixed. First, the code has been validated with the available experimental data in literature. After validation, static drift, static rudder and drift and rudder tests have been simulated. The forces and moments acting on the hull have been computed with URANS approach. Numerical results have been applied to determine the hydrodynamic maneuvering coefficients, such as, velocity terms and rudder terms. The acceleration, angular velocity and cross-coupled terms have been taken from the available experimental data. A computer program has been developed to apply a fast maneuvering simulation technique. Abkowitz’s non-linear mathematical model has been used to calculate the forces and moment acting on the hull during the maneuvering motion. Euler method on the other hand has been applied to solve the simultaneous differential equations. Turning and zig-zag maneuvering simulations have been carried out and the maneuvering characteristics have been determined and the numerical simulation results have been compared with the available data in literature. In addition, viscous effects have been investigated using Eulerian approach for several static drift cases.},

permits predicting ship motions and therefore advancing control safety and maneuverability for the offshore ship

hydrodynamic coefficients to establish highly accurate mathematical models. In this paper, a support vector machine
method is proposed for the hydrodynamic parameter identification of a nonlinear maneuvering model for a surface

maneuvering datasets are included as training data. The 3-DOF hydrodynamic derivatives are identified and
validated by the multiple support vector regression model. The generalization performance of the obtained nonlinear
model is explored by comparing the outputs of the identified model with the original maneuvering data on the
evaluation dataset, a dataset that contains separate variable zigzag and turning circle maneuvers tests. The
satisfactory agreements between predicted motions and original motions demonstrate the validity and generalization

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the fundamental properties associated with the Nomoto models. Specifically, the state space model associated with the first order Nomoto model is both observable and controllable. The state space model associated with the second order Nomoto model is also observable; however, it is controllable only if the effective sway time constant is different from the effective yaw time constant. The zero appearing in the transfer function model is found responsible for the overshoot behaviors, which are typical in the yaw rate for large rudder angle steering. This suggests that a second order Nomoto model is more appropriate if the overshoot feature is to be properly modeled. Both the first and second order Nomoto transfer function models are identifiable, with an ill-conditioning problem associated the latter. This makes the first order Nomoto model very popular in the adaptive autopilot applications. Model reduction for a fourth order transfer function ship model describing the sway-yaw-roll dynamics is conducted to reach the second order Nomoto model describing the sway-yaw dynamics and the first order Nomoto model describing the yaw dynamics itself, and the Bode plots for these models are given to show the changes in system frequency response caused by model simplification. Thus, appropriate model structures can be selected according to the intended frequency range of application to meet the modeling accuracy requirements.},

The time series used in training the network are obtained from simulated data of zigzag maneuvers and the proposed method has been applied to these data. The neural network scheme adopted in this work has one middle or hidden layer of neurons and it employs the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm.

	abstract = {Combined with the free-running model tests of KVLCC ship, the system identification (SI) based on support vector machines (SVM) is proposed for the prediction of ship maneuvering motion. The hydrodynamic derivatives in an Abkowitz model are determined by the Lagrangian factors and the support vectors in the SVM regression model. To obtain the optimized structural factors in SVM, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is incorporated into SVM. To diminish the drift of hydrodynamic derivatives after regression, a difference method is adopted to reconstruct the training samples before identification. The validity of the difference method is verified by correlation analysis. Based on the Abkowitz mathematical model, the simulation of ship maneuvering motion is conducted. Comparison between the predicted results and the test results demonstrates the validity of the proposed methods in this paper.},

The present paper introduces this machine learning technology to the field of marine hydrodynamics for the study of complex potential and viscous flow problems. Examples considered include the forecasting of the seastate elevations and vessel responses using their past time records as “explanatory variables” or “features” and the development of a nonlinear model for the roll restoring, added moment of inertia and viscous damping using the vessel response kinematics from free decay tests as “features”. A key innovation of AI-SVM kernel algorithms is that the nonlinear dependence of the dependent variable on the “features” is embedded into the SVM kernel and its selection plays a key role in the performance of the algorithms. The kernel selection is discussed and its relation to the physics of the marine hydrodynamic flows considered in the present paper is addressed.},

	abstract = {Determination of ship maneuvering models is a tough task of ship maneuverability prediction. Among several prime approaches of estimating ship maneuvering models, system identification combined with the full‐scale or free‐ running model test is preferred. In this contribution, real‐time system identification programs using recursive identification method, such as the recursive least square method (RLS), are exerted for on‐line identification of ship maneuvering models. However, this method seriously depends on the objects of study and initial values of identified parameters. To overcome this, an intelligent technology, i.e., support vector machines (SVM), is firstly used to estimate initial values of the identified parameters with finite samples. As real measured motion data of the Mariner class ship always involve noise from sensors and external disturbances, the zigzag simulation test data include a substantial quantity of Gaussian white noise. Wavelet method and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) are used to filter the data corrupted by noise, respectively. The choice of the sample number for SVM to decide initial values of identified parameters is extensively discussed and analyzed. With de‐noised motion data as input‐output training samples, parameters of ship maneuvering models are estimated using RLS and SVM‐RLS, respectively. The comparison between identification results and true values of parameters demonstrates that both the identified ship maneuvering models from RLS and SVM‐RLS have reasonable agreements with simulated motions of the ship, and the increment of the sample for SVM positively affects the identification results. Furthermore, SVM‐RLS using data de‐noised by EMD shows the highest accuracy and best convergence.},

	abstract = {new calculation method for the steering forces of a pod propulsor is presented. This method is also applied to a hybrid propulsion where a shaft-line-driven main propeller is located straight in front of a contra-rotating propeller, powered by an electric pod. 

In the calculations the pod unit is divided into four parts: a rotating propeller, a strut, a motor housing and a fin. The forces are calculated separately for each part. Interaction between these parts is estimated by using simplified methods.

The required input data consists of the open water characteristics of both propellers and a
simplified outline geometry of the pod unit. The method is developed to the first quadrant of the pod propeller and applies only to steering angles that are less than the stall angle of the pod unit.

The calculation method has been validated by comparing its results with the results of an extensive model test program. Transverse and longitudinal forces are estimated rather accurately. The accuracy is significantly improved for a high loading of a propeller. The calculation method applies better to a separate tractor pod. However, the results are good also in the hybrid propulsion case.},

Many models provide partial knowledge about a system. To handle the deﬁciency and improve model ﬁdelity, we propose a hybrid modeling methodology, in which prior knowledge describing the ship dynamic effects is incorporated into a data-driven calibrator, yielding a representative model with high predictive capability. Enabled by the integration of model estimated ship states into the calibrator, the informative information could be interpreted and carried forward. Simulation and full-scale experiments are conducted on the research vessel Gunnerus to exemplify the concept. A best available numerical model and a neural network are prepared to be the foundation and calibrator, respectively. Experiment results show that the cooperative model greatly improves the predictive capability of the research vessel. From the ship modeling perspective, this study provides new insights by bridging the gap between two separate domains: model-based and data-driven.},

	abstract = {Ship maneuvering models are the keys to the research of ship maneuverability, design of ship motion control system and development of ship handling simulators. For various frames of ship maneuvering models, determining the parameters of the models is always a tedious task. System identification theory can be used to establish system mathematical models by the system’s input data and output data. In this paper, based on the analysis of ship hydrodynamics, a nonlinear model frame of ship maneuvering is established. System identification theory is employed to estimate the parameters of the model. An algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter theory is proposed to calculate the parameters. In order to gain the system’s input and output data, which is necessary for the parameters identification experiment, turning circle tests and Zig-zag tests are performed on shiphandling simulator and the initial data is collected. Based on the Fixed Interval Kalman Smoothing algorithm, a pre-processing algorithm is proposed to process the raw data of the tests. With this algorithm, the errors introduced during the measurement process are eliminated. Parameters identification experiments are designed to estimate the model parameters, and the ship maneuvering model parameters estimation algorithm is extended to modify the parameters being estimated. Then the model parameters and the ship maneuvering model are determined. Simulation validation was carried out to simulate the ship maneuverability. Comparisons have been made to the simulated data and measured data. The results show that the ship maneuvering model determined by our approach can seasonably reflect the actual motion of ship, and the parameter estimation procedure and algorithms are effective.},

Aiming at the inconvenience of obtaining model parameters under the traditional experimental method, this article studies the parameter identification of unmanned marine vehicle’s manoeuvring model based on extended Kalman filter and support vector machine. Firstly, the second-order nonlinear manoeuvring response model of unmanned marine vehicle is discretized by the difference method, and the corresponding data are collected by the manoeuvring motion simulation of the response model. Secondly, the discrete response model is transformed into an augmented state vector based on extended Kalman filter, and the optimal estimation of the state vector is calculated to identify the parameters. And then, the discrete response model is transformed into a support vector machine-based regression model, the collected data are processed and a set of support vectors are obtained to further identify the parameters of the response model. Finally, by comparing the simulation experiments’ results from the original model and the identification model, the recognition results-based extended Kalman filter and support vector machine are analysed and some research results are obtained. The results of this article will provide a powerful reference for the design of unmanned marine vehicle’s motion control algorithm.},

For the supervision of dough fermentation, a continuous-discrete extended Kalman filter was applied, which uses an image analysis system as the measurement. By estimation a fixed number of gas bubbles inside the dough, the radius of an average bubble was determined. A mathematical dough model was used by the extended Kalman filter to estimate the radius of the average bubble, the CO2 concentration of the non-gas dough phase and the number of CO2 molecules in the average bubble. During a fermentation of 50 min, the extended Kalman filter estimated that the average radius increased from 50 µm to 127 µm, the CO2 concentration in the non-gas dough increased to 23 mol/m³, and the CO2 amount in the bubble increased from 0.1 × 10−10 to 4 × 10−10 mol. Also, the specific CO2 production rate was estimated to be in the range from 1.5 × 10−3 to more than 4 × 10−3 mol·m³/kg/s.

	abstract = {Parameter drift is a tricky problem in system identification, and collinearity in the identified model is considered to be its
cause in the field of statistical learning. To diminish the
parameter drift and identify the model parameters more
accurately, a better understanding of the characteristics of
collinearity is necessary. System identification is one of the
effective modeling methods in the study of ship
manoeuvrability. This paper aims at quantifying and analyzing
the collinearity in the modeling of ship manoeuvring motion by
using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). By utilizing the multiple
datasets including those from zigzag and turning tests and the
combinations of manoeuvres, as well as the data processed by
D-optimizing design or difference method, the VIF is applied to
quantify the severity of collinearity of different model
structures. The results show that the selected manoeuvring
models have high collinearity under the data of single standard
manoeuvre. The pre-processed test data and an appropriate
model structure can alleviate the collinearity, hence to diminish the parameter drift. However, the collinearity of the selected
models cannot be eliminated. Some suggestions are given for
selecting more appropriate training data and mathematical
model structures of ship manoeuvring to accurately estimate the
model parameters.},

However, a ship can rarely follow pre-defined speeds because dynamic sea environments lead to continuous speed variation. In this paper, a voyage optimization method is proposed to optimize ship engine power to reduce fuel and air emissions. It is a combination of dynamic programming and genetic algorithm to solve voyage planning in three-dimensions. In this method, the engine power is discretized into several levels. The potential benefit of using this algorithm is investigated by a medium-size chemical tanker. A ship’s actual sailing is used to demonstrate benefits of the proposed method. On average 3.4\% of fuel-saving and emission reduction can be achieved than state-of-the-art deterministic methods. If compared with the actual full-scale measurements, on average 5.6\% reduction of fuel consumption and GHG emis­ sions (about 275 tons) can be expected by the proposed method for the six case study voyages.},

Heave, roll and pitch radiation damping are estimated from a non-linear unified seakeeping/maneuvering time-domain tool using numerical decay tests and then implemented to a 6–DoF model in the form of critical damping and natural period. Short waves are idealised by numerical integration along the vessel’s waterline profile and associated hydrodynamic actions are implemented in a response curve format. For the rapid assessment of hull in-plane hydrodynamic forces, derivatives are implemented via semi-empirical methods, CFD or model test data. Results are validated against experiments available for zig-zag and turning cycle trajectories of vessels with different hull forms and propulsion configurations. It is concluded that the approach presented is feasible for the prediction of maneu­ vering trajectories of existing or new-build vessels and for estimating the evasive velocity in way of contact before grounding.},

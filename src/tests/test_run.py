"""
This module contains an example test.

Tests should be placed in ``vessel_manoeuvring_models/tests``, in modules that mirror your
project's structure, and in files named test_*.py. They are simply functions
named ``test_*`` which test a unit of logic.

To run the tests, run ``kedro test`` from the project root directory.

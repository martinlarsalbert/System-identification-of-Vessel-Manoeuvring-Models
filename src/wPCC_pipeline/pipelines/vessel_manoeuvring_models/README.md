# Pipeline vessel_manoeuvring_models

## Overview

The Parameter Identification Techique (PIT) can be run on various Vessel Manoeuvring Models (VMMs). This pipeline creates VMMs to be fed to the PIT pipelines. 

## Pipeline inputs
No input, the equations in the VMMs are imported.

## Pipeline outputs
* VMMs as VMM objects (including Equation Of Motion (EOM) and damping force ppolynomials)
